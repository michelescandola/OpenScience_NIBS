## "If I am applying a correct statistical approach"

In analysing our data, we can follow one of four main approaches [@gelman2013garden]:

1.  `r fa("hourglass", fill = "grey")` Applying a unique statistical test on data.
2.  `r fa("medal", fill = "green")` Applying a pre-registered statistical test on data, pre-specifying all choices.
3.  `r fa("triangle-exclamation", fill = "orange")` Applying a statistical test on data, that would be different given a different data set (**Researcher's dof**)
4.  `r fa("skull-crossbones", fill = "red")` Applying all possible choices in data handling and statistical tests (the so-called **fishing**) ![](images/sampei.jpg)

---

### "If I am applying a correct statistical approach"

-   Data are not passively collected and analysed.
-   Removing outliers, transforming variables, choosing independent variables and<br>confounders are routine decisions for researchers.
-   From a single data set, we can have multiple processed data sets.
-   Researchers select a single (or a few) data processing choices and then present this as the only analysis that ever would have been done.
-   The inevitable arbitrariness in the data and the sensitivity of the result is hidden to the reader.

- [@steegen2016increasing]

* ~~If I am _objective_~~ Because we fail to be objective,
* ~~If I am employing state-of-the-art methods~~ because my methodological choices have an impact on results,
* ~~If I am rigorously collecting data~~ because of data sampling variability,
* ~~If I am applying a correct statistical approach~~ because there are many accepted statistical approaches,

# Study 1

## Modulating intertemporal choices through midfrontal tACS

::: center
![](images/title article fusco 2024.png){width=100% height=100%}
:::

[@fusco2024modulating]

## Theoretical Background and Previous Findings

### Conflict monitoring

- To reach optimal decisions, the brain requires efficient and specialised systems [@ullsperger2001subprocesses].
- Theoretical and computational models $\leftarrow$ ACC and MFC as hub-like regions for conflict and error monitoring [@botvinick2001conflict].
- Conflict and error processing $\leftarrow$ enhanced midfrontal $\theta$ oscillations (MF $\theta$ ) [@cavanagh2014frontal]
- Applying $\theta$ tACS to midfrontal areas fasten the decisional process [@fusco2018midfrontal].

## Theoretical Background and Previous Findings

### Transcranial Alternate Current Stimulation (tACS)

::: center
<img src="images/tACS-1.png" width="500"/>
:::
[@wischnewski2023neurocognitive]


## Research Questions

1. investigate whether MF$\theta$ impact conflict processing.
2. explore behavioural carry-over effects.
- we wanted to be as robust and transparent as possible $\rightarrow$ *Registered Report* .

## Registered Report

**Definition**  

A **Registered Report** is a type of scientific article in which the **study rationale and methods are peer-reviewed before data collection begins**.

::: center

![](images/IPA.png){width=70% height=70%}

:::

## Registered Report

**Purpose:**

- Reduces **publication bias**.
- Promotes **transparency** and **reproducibility**.
- Encourages stronger **study design** through early feedback.

## Registered Report

- **Stage 1: Before Data Collection**
  - Submit **Introduction, Methods, and Proposed Analyses**.
  - Peer-reviewed for:
    - **Theoretical importance**.
    - **Rigor and feasibility**.
  - If accepted: receive **In-Principle Acceptance (IPA)**.

- **Stage 2: After Data Collection**
  - Submit **Results and Discussion**.
  - Review checks whether:
    - The protocol was followed.
    - Conclusions are supported by data.
  - Results **cannot be rejected** based on outcome alone.
  
> **Key Benefit:**  
> Protects against p-hacking, HARKing, and selective reporting.

## Procedure

### Stage 1

To test the procedure and methodology and calculate the effect size to estimate the sample size for the study, we performed a PILOT STUDY.

- 14 healthy participants (F = 5; age = $24.86 \pm 2.13$) received tACS during the TD where we manipulated the conflict level associated with rewards (low, medium, high).

### Flanker Task

**Definition:**  

A **Flanker Task** is a psychological test used to measure **attention** and **inhibitory control**. It assesses how well a person can resist interference from **distracting stimuli** (_flankers_) surrounding a target.

- **How it works:**
  - Participants respond to a **central target stimulus**.
  - Target is flanked by **congruent** or **incongruent** stimuli.
  - Example:
    - **Congruent:** HH**H**HH
    - **Incongruent:** SS**H**SS

- **Key Metrics:**
  - **Reaction Time (RT)**: Slower in incongruent trials.
  - **Accuracy**: Often lower when flanking stimuli conflict.
  - **Post Error Slowing** (PES): $PES = RT_{\text{post error}} - RT_{\text{pre error}}$ [@damaso2020evidence].

Unexpectedly, both $\theta$ and $\gamma$ driven neuromodulation speeded-up decisions compared to sham. 

- Exploratory analyses;
  - When RT effects were normalized to sham, $\theta$ tACS had stronger RT effects than $\gamma$ tACS only in high-conflict trials.
  - Association between Attentional Impulsiveness (BIS11) and choices during $\theta$ tACS stimulation.

## Conclusions

- Both $\theta$ and $\gamma$ tACS speed up decisions, but only $\theta$ appears to enhance processing in high-conflict scenarios, aligning with its role in conflict monitoring.
  - $\theta \rightarrow$ conflict monitoring (?).
  - $\gamma \rightarrow$ attentional control, abstract reasoning and working memory [@howard2003gamma] [@taylor2022longitudinal] (?).
- No support for tACS (either frequency) influencing preference outcomes (e.g., choices).
- Individual differences (e.g., attentional impulsiveness) may modulate theta-tACS effects, especially in high-conflict trials.

- 30 minutes effect size: d = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.36; 95%CI = [-0.19, 1.32]

### High variability among the studies

- Dependent variability: peak-to-peak MEP amplitude, baseline-to-peak MEP amplitude, or MEP area.
- Number of trials: 10, 20, 30 or 40 trials.
- Removal of Non-responding MEPs: MEPs equal to zero will be either removed or retained in the dataset.
- etc...

- Moreover, small sample sizes.

## Research Question

1. to investigate whether applying tSMS to the lM1 produces a measurable and significant reduction in MEP amplitude.
2. description of sources of variability and confounds in the experimental procedures and analytical processes involved in the verification of the main hypothesis.
- we want to be as robust and transparent as possible $\rightarrow$ *Registered Report*.
- we want to consider all the potential variants of analysis $\rightarrow$ *Multiverse Analysis*

### Multiverse Analysis

1.  a method to increase the robustness of the analyses:

<blockquote>

-   *[...]* the statistical result based on the single data set reflects only one possible outcome in a multiverse of possible outcomes. Without knowing which other statistical results could have reasonably been observed, it is impossible to evaluate the **robustness of the finding**. [@steegen2016increasing, p. 704]

</blockquote>

2.  a method to increase the transparency of results:

<blockquote>

-   **Transparency** could be increased by performing, for each research question, the same analysis for all possible data sets, defined by the reasonable choices for data processing. [@steegen2016increasing, p. 704]

</blockquote>

3.  A method that can help in pre-registratering  new studies:

<blockquote>

-   **In novel studies, preregistration can be difficult** because researchers often lack sufficient knowledge to be able to foresee how they should deal with all possible decisions that need to be made when analyzing the data. [@girardi2022, p. 5]

</blockquote>

4.  A method that considers only the reasonable choices:

<blockquote>

-   A multiverse analysis involves performing the analysis of interest across the whole set of data sets that arise from different **reasonable choices for data processing**. [@steegen2016increasing, p. 703]

# General Conclusions

## General Conclusions

- NIBS research can improve neuroscientific knowledge
- The variety of methodologies, techniques and statistical decisions might hinder the impact of an experimental finding.
- Open Science can improve transparency, trusthworthness and robustness of researc.
- Pre-registrations and **Registered reports** give the freedom not to worry about the result.
- Multiverse analysis give the freedom to show that your result is really robust.

## General Conclusions

**European  mandate**

As of the Work Programme 2017

the Open Research Data pilot is extended to  cover all
thematic areas of Horizon 2020  per default.

However, the Commission recognizes that  some research data cannot
be made open  and applies the principle of
'as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.

It is therefore possible to opt out of
research data sharing at any stage - before  or
after the signature of the grant agreement - but reasons have to be given


## Thanks everybody for you attention!
